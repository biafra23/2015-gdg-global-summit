# Garages

Garage sessions were selected by popular vote from a series of submissions from the community. The list of submissions can be [found here](call4paperz.com/events/gdg-summit-2015-gdg-garage-projects).

The **top 5 vote-getters** were accepted and scheduled on Day 2 (Wednesday) in Green Room 1 (G1). The selected proposals are listed below (in abstract). Each garage has its own dedicated section to capture notes from that section.

**Abstract**:

Do you want more bandwidth for your Android Fundamentals Study Jams? Yes, you do. Android Studio, SDK Manager, and the recommended version of JDK. Itâ€™s a lot to download, not to mention the SDK packages waiting for you in Android SDK Manager. GDG Suzhou will show you how to save your bandwidth by making everything available on LAN.
